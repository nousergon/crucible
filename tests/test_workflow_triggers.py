"""A check grades the diff; a live-state check does not belong on a PR at all.

`scm-platform-policy.md` §3.1, Brian ruling 2026-08-10: a check whose subject is
live infrastructure — or the state of the system at a phase boundary — has two
failure modes on a `pull_request`, and both are wrong there. It reports the
author's own change as drift, or it reports someone else's out-of-band change,
which the author cannot clear. The second survives every fix aimed at the first,
which is why the rule sits at the TRIGGER and not at the comparison.

The fleet holds this with a per-repo guard test (`nousergon-data-PR1293`,
`nous-ergon-ops-PR386`, `crucible-predictor-PR460`). This repo was created after
those landed and did not carry one, so the acceptance gate — which calls
`cloudformation:ListStackResources` — ran on every PR here for the repo's whole
life and made every one of them read red (measured 2026-09-02: seven open
Dependabot PRs, all UNSTABLE on that single check).

**The allowlist is the primary control, and it is load-bearing.** The first
version of this guard matched live-state markers (`aws `, `boto3`,
`tests/acceptance`) in each step's `run:` body. Six shapes walked straight past
it, all demonstrated: a job-level `uses:` reusable workflow with no steps to
scan, a marker in `with:` rather than `run:`, a marker behind a called script, a
tab instead of the space in `"aws "`, configure-aws-credentials plus a
`crucible` command reaching S3, and `pull_request_target`. A marker list is a
list of the known-bad that only ever grows — the structure `AGENTS.md` rule 4
and plan §11.1 forbid for suppression collections. So the question is inverted:
every job reachable on a PR event is live-state UNTIL it is named in
`PR_REACHABLE_JOBS` with a reason.

**There is deliberately no second layer here scanning step bodies.** Five
independent adversarial reviews attacked one, and each fix opened the next
round's hole — a `--collect-only` substring licensing the next line, then a
per-command splitter beaten by a single `&` and by a trailing `# comment`,
then a boundary rule that rejected `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. The class is that any
predicate over a `run:` body is a partial shell parser, and a partial shell
parser is a denylist of the syntax someone thought of — the structure
`AGENTS.md` rule 4 forbids.

That scan is defence in depth, not the §3.1 requirement, and it belongs where
it will be reused: `alpha-engine-config-I9830` lifts this guard into
`nousergon-lib` for the whole fleet, built on a typed workflow model rather
than text. Hardening it once there beats hardening it five times here. The
gap until then is narrower than what this file already closes: a live-AWS
step added INSIDE the already-allowlisted `ci.yml:test` job.

**`pull_request_target` is held to the same rule, and needs its own exclusion
string.** On a `pull_request_target` event `github.event_name` is
`'pull_request_target'`, so `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` evaluates
TRUE and the job runs. An earlier version of this file accepted that expression
as an exclusion on any workflow, which meant the guard failed open on the one
trigger it claims to hold most tightly — the one that runs with base-repo
write-scoped secrets. The exclusion must cover every PR event the workflow
actually declares.
